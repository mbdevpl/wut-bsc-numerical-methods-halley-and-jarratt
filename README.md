## about this report

This report describes our solution to the following task:
write a computer program to implement the Halley and the Jarratt's methods for
finding a root of the complex polynomial.

This report was written towards completion of
Numerical Methods course during authors' Bachelor studies
at Warsaw University of Technology in year 2011.
